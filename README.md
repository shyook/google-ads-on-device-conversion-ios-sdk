# GoogleAdsOnDeviceConversion
This repo hosts the GoogleAdsOnDeviceConversion Swift Package Manager distribution.

GoogleAdsOnDeviceConversion only supports Google and Google's App Attribution Partner (AAP) libraries. This update will incorporate additional de-identified, temporary signals, such as data derived from IP-address-based attributes, to improve iOS campaign optimization and reporting in third-party App Attribution Partner interfaces - all while continuing to protect user privacy. Any issues should be reported to the product that is using GoogleAdsOnDeviceConversion.

As a reminder, you have the option to display a prominent link in your disclosures to make clear how Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services, including information about the technologies used.
